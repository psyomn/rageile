RAGEILE 
---------------------------------------------
Simple idea; have a task management server somewhere you want, which can be easilly
configured and runned. 

This project is still in baby steps and should not be used for any 'serious' things at the momment. 

TODO 
----
* Make sure the model makes sense
* Check to see how database storage fares
